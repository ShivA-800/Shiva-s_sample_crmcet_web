# College Website Project

## Project Overview
I have developed a simple, static website that represents a **college website** using only **HTML** and **CSS**. This project may be small in scope, but it has been an incredibly valuable learning experience for me. By focusing solely on HTML for structure and CSS for styling, I was able to explore and understand the foundational aspects of web development deeply.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this project was to strengthen my grasp of the **core web technologies**. While it may seem basic at first glance, this website helped me gain experience in:
- Structuring web pages with HTML.
- Styling and positioning elements using CSS.
- Creating responsive layouts using media queries (if applicable).
- Understanding how to organize code for readability and scalability.

## Features
- A **clean, minimal layout** that represents a college’s homepage.
- A simple **navigation bar** to guide users to various sections (About, Departments, Contact).
- **Responsive design**, allowing the website to adjust to different screen sizes (if applicable).
- Usage of basic **CSS animations and transitions** to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: To structure the content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: To add styling, layout, and responsiveness to the website.

## Folder Structure
```
├── index.html        # Main webpage

├── contact.html      # Contact page (if any)
└── styles/
    └── style.css     # Main CSS file for styling
```

## Future Improvements
- Adding **JavaScript** for interactivity, such as dynamic forms and enhanced user experiences.
- Improving the responsiveness and adding more detailed content sections.
- Integrating with a backend for user login, course details, etc.

## What I Learned
- How to effectively structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements.
- How to use various CSS properties for styling, layout, and simple animations.
- The importance of organizing code for better maintainability.
