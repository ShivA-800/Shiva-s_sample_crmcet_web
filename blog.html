                <h3>TRAINING PROGRAMMES</h3>
                <p>The Training Program generally deals with all the aspects of soft skills required by any individual to face an interview process. The duration of the program is around 40hours in which the following aspects are dealt with
                    • Aptitude (Arithmetic, Reasoning & Verbal)
                    • Presentation Skills
                    • Interpersonal & Behavioral Skills
                    • Resume Building Skills
                    • Group Discussion Skills
                    • Interview Skills    
                    In addition to the soft skills training program, we also conduct a 10hour program to refresh the technical skills of final year students to face the Technical test & Interviews. This program basically deals with “C” and Data Structures and is very much helpful for the non-computer science students who opt for software jobs.</p>
